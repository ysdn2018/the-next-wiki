## the-next-base boilerplate

[https://github.com/ysdn2018/the-next-base](https://github.com/ysdn2018/the-next-base)

Boilerplate that we can build off of for digital team projects. Basic understanding of how React and Gatsby work is recommended.

### Structure

We are following a pretty standard Gatsby setup. \*to-do: explain structure\*

### Future

Components and base styles are light/non-existant as of right now. Will be updated with official brand guidelines when those are availible.
