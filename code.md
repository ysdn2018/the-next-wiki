### what we’re using

For the digital web experience this year we are going to be building the site using [**React**](https://reactjs.org/). Think of it like HTML on steroids using javascript. It allows us to have an incredibly fast site and an organized component system.

We’re also using [**Gatsby**](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), which is a static site generator for React. Pretty much it makes building a static site with React much easier and faster by attracting away a lot of the underlying tech.

For CSS we are using [**Styled-Components**](https://www.styled-components.com/) which is a CSS-in-JS framework that makes essential makes it so you create components with styles, rather than site-wide css.

For our backend for submitting case studies/etc on the main site we are using [**Netlify CMS**](https://www.netlifycms.org/), which is essentially a markdown editor that will allow people to use the site. \(this part isn't set in stone yet, Netlify CMS is still in early development\)

For deployment we will be using [**Netlify**](https://www.netlify.com/) which is free & super fast static hosting. Unless we want to pay $50/month we're just gonna have to use @huntercaron's personal account \(which we currently are\).

For collaborating on code we will be using [**Github**](https://github.com/), feel free to use the [desktop client](https://desktop.github.com/) as its pretty easy to use. You can learn more about github [here](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git) and [here](https://guides.github.com/).

### what you need to know

Most of the setup and config will be ready to go, so really you just need to have a working knowledge of javascript & css, and a basic knowledge of how React and Styled Components work.

##  boilerplate

https://github.com/huntercaron/boiled

Boilerplate that we can build off of for digital team projects. Basic understanding of how React and Gatsby work is recommended.

### Structure

We are following a pretty standard Gatsby setup. \*to-do: explain structure\*

### Future

Components and base styles are light/non-existant as of right now. Will be updated with official brand guidelines when those are availible.
