Welcome to the Digital Team!



### overview

This is official wiki of the YSDN 2018 grad show digital experience. In here will be everything learning resources to setting up your development environment. If you have any questions feel free to reach out. 



### what we’re using

For the digital web experience this year we are going to be building the site using \[\*\*React\*\*\]\(\). Think of it like HTML on steroids using javascript. It allows us to have an incredibly fast site and an organized component system.



We’re also using \[\*\*Gatsby\*\*\]\(\), which is a static site generator for React. Pretty much it makes building a static site with React much easier and faster by attracting away a lot of the underlying tech.



For CSS we are using \[\*\*Styled-Components\*\*\]\(\) which is a CSS-in-JS framework that makes essential makes it so you create components with styles, rather than site-wide css.



For our backend for submitting case studies/etc on the main site we are using \[\*\*Netlify CMS\*\*\]\(\), which is essentially a markdown editor that will allow people to use the site.
